# Frontend Technical Challenge

This repository contains solutions to front-end coding challenges in javascript and react (with typescript).

### Running the solutions

All `.js` files are standalone and can be executed with **Node.js**:

```bash
node file-name.js
```

Example:

```bash
node 7-carrot-bag.js
```

If it is a **React** app folder:

1. `cd folder-name`
2. Follow the README inside (usually `npm install && npm run dev`).
